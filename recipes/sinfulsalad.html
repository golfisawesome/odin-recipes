            <h2>About this recipe</h2>
            Susan Brown says, "This has been Jay's birthday cake since he was about 14 or 15 years old".
            When he would come home on leave from the Navy his first request would be this delicious Sinful Salad. 
            Not bad considering it was created by a family of devout Christians! Makes 12 servings at 225 cals.
